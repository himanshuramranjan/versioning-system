User Interaction Flow:
--------------------

1. Initialize Repository:
User -> Main -> Repository
   |            |
   |            v
   |         Create Initial Commit
   |            |
   |            v
   |         Create Main Branch
   |
   v
Start Making Changes

2. File Changes & Commit:
User -> Working Directory -> Add/Modify Files
   |         |
   |         v
   |     Document (state: MODIFIED/UNTRACKED)
   |         |
   v         v
VersionManager.commit() -> Create New Commit
                             |
                             v
                          Update Branch HEAD

3. Branch Operations:
User -> Repository.createBranch("feature")
   |         |
   |         v
   |     Create New Branch (points to current HEAD)
   |         |
   v         v
Repository.switchBranch("feature")
            |
            v
         Set Current Branch

4. Stash Operations:
User -> VersionManager.stash()
   |         |
   |         v
   |     Save Working Directory to Current Branch's Stash (per-branch, not global!)
   |         |
   v         v
VersionManager.stashPop()
   |         |
   |         v
   |     Restore Files from Stash (only if stashed in this branch)
   |
   v
Continue Working

5. Merge Flow:
User -> VersionManager.mergeBranches()
            |
            v
        Get Source Branch HEAD Snapshot
            |
            v
        Overwrite Target Branch Working Directory with Source Files (simple overwrite, not 3-way merge)
            |
            v
        Create Merge Commit in Target Branch
            |
            v
        Update Current Branch HEAD

6. Status Check:
User -> VersionManager.status()
            |
            v
        Compare Working Directory with HEAD
            |
            v
        Display Modified/Untracked Files

7. View History:
User -> VersionManager.log()
            |
            v
        Get Current Branch HEAD
            |
            v
        Traverse Commit Chain
            |
            v
        Display Commit Info
